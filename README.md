# Cosmos-Casino

One of our team-mate was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of https://stake.com/ which was giving a 200% bonus on the first deposit, when our team-mate deposited the 120 USDT into this platform they gave him 360 USDT as total balance and when our teammate started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to play with $1 per game of Plinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 because he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limits which said that if he wanted to withdraw the deposited amount then he had to play $12,300 worth of games this was a big shock for him when he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, he played the game Plinko the entire night and lost all his money.

He was very annoyed by this and that's how Cosmos-Casino was born, which is a combination of Gamefi and Defi all in one platform where new web2 and web3 gamers/ gamblers can play games, and perform gambling but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also, we wanted to address common issues in traditional gaming and gambling platforms.

### Problem:
The traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:
- **User Adoption:** Existing platforms struggle to bring new users into Web3 due to complex interfaces, complicated wallets, bad UI/UX and difficult infra.

- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** 90% of platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play, Opaque Algorithms and Unfair Odds.

- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.

- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits, delays and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.

- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.

- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralized platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.

---

### Solution:
 Cosmos-Casino addresses these problems by offering:
- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilizing our custom-built on-chain randomness module (VRF) within the Cosmos Ecosystem we ensure all game outcomes are transparent and verifiably fair.

- **Low Fees and Flexible Policies:** Leveraging Cosmos Interchain and Neutron blockchain efficiency and scalable data transfers to minimize costs and remove withdrawal restrictions.

- **Cross-Chain Asset Transfers:** Seamless cross-chain transactions between Chains for ease of gameplay.

- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users unrestricted funds access.

- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and Clean bonus terms without hidden traps.

- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralized asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.

### Key Features:
**Cosmos-Casino** offers a multifaceted platform:

**GameFi - Gaming Aspect:**
- **Cosmos-Casino** initially has a fully on-chain functional **European roulette game**.
- Users can place various types of bets such as **straight, split, street, corner, six line, column, dozen, red, black, high, low, even, and odd.**
- The **roulette wheel** randomly generates winning values using our in-built VRF & randomness module. A secure messaging ensures game logic is executed reliably across chains.
- Winnings are automatically calculated and transferred to the user's wallet via keplr.

**Defi - Lending Aspect:**
- Users can **deposit any tokens on Cosmos supported chain as collateral to borrow in-game currency (APTC)** such that if the user holding is in $ATOM token and if the value of $ATOM token goes up by 10% in markets then the value of the collateral goes up by 10% and users can enjoy playing games/ gambling without facing any financial losses as the in-game currency(APTC) is stable and has nothing to deal with collateral but if the collateral value hits a negative threshold of -10% in 24 hours then the APTC token will also be deducted similarly just like the case with mortgage NFT platforms like Ordinals.
- Facilitates gameplay without the need to sell existing holdings.
- Ensures players have the necessary assets to participate in games seamlessly using real-time asset prices.

**Diverse Game Selection:** A variety of fully on-chain games, including roulette, mines, wheel of luck, blackjack, plinko, and more. As a (POC) Proof of Concept we developed fully on-chain Roulette but a similar model can be applied to introduce the new casino games to the platform.

Interchain is used to transfer funds to other chains, So let's say you are playing games on Cosmos Testnet right? So you need some in-game currency (APTC Token) on the Cosmos Testnet to play that game but Cosmos-Casino is deployed on Evmos, so we are using Interchain APP Contracts as cross-chain communication between the Evmos and Cosmos Testnet, and transfer your tokens on Cosmos Testnet and at last you can play any APT-Casino games by the help of APTC Token on any of the destination chain. So, this is how we used this Interchain to solve this problem for user ease.

### What's next:
All though started as an idea but now we are thinking of carrying it forward as a business model and expanding further.

- Applying for Grants: Seeking funding to further develop and expand the platform.

- Mainnet Launch: Deploying on the mainnet for real-world use.

- User Testing: Conducting extensive user testing to refine the platform, we conducted 20 user testing on testnet during hackathon.

- Promoting the Product: Marketing to attract a wider audience.

- Introducing new games to the platform.

- Explore additional DeFi features like staking, farming, yield strategies to offer more financial services within the platform.

- We aim to implement gasless transactions to enhance user convenience.

- Enabling Developers to build more transparent games in our platform, We can pivot our current platform to game launchpad too but we stick to the decisions of Cosmos and Neutron judges, mentors and our future advisors, angel investors, VCs and so on.

- Bringing in new monetization schemas to compensate the casino games/ game creators.

- Having an in-built live streaming, for gameplay we may utilize livepeer/ lens/ huddle01 for this feature and allow players, influencers to do streaming within the application.

- We also plan to introduce an in-game chat feature where gamblers/ gamers/ our users can chat and predict the outcome of the games so making its perspective and narrative towards SOCIALFI as well.
